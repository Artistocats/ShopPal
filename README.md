## What is ShopPal?

ShopPal is a simple and smart application that predicts your shopping for you! :D

## How does it work?

Every time you go shopping, simply checkout with the products you bought. ShopPal will predict with increasing accuracy the depletion rates and bind each item with an appropriate color. Is it green? No worries, plenty left! Is it red? Oops! You better hurry and resupply!
